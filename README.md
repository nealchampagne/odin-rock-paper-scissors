# Rock Paper Scissors

## Description
This is my implementation of the Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors JavaScript project.

I used a while loop instead of a separate "playGame" function and made the game best 3 out of 5 rather than playing a full 5 rounds for no reason if you've already lost/won.
