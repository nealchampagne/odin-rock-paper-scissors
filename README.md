# Rock Paper Scissors

## Description
This is my implementation of the Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors JavaScript project with a simple 3-button UI.

The game now uses click events to drive the function calls and goes until either the computer or the human player reach 5 points. The results are displayed through DOM manipulation.
